# Fake News Detection Using Longformer

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news by fine-tuning Longformer. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content. 


## Choice of Model

**Longformer** is chosen for this project because it is designed to handle longer context lengths compared to earlier transformer models. This is particularly advantageous for news classification, where articles can be quite lengthy. Longformer's ability to process extended contexts allows it to better understand and classify long-form content, making it well-suited for this task.

## Other Technologies Used

- **NLTK**
- **PyTorch**
